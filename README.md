#  Car Price Prediction – Machine Learning Portfolio Project

## About This Project

This project is part of my **Machine Learning portfolio**, developed to demonstrate my ability to apply data science concepts to real-world business problems.

The objective is to build a **predictive model for car prices** in the US automobile market and, more importantly, to extract **actionable insights** that can support strategic decision-making.

## Business Problem

To compete effectively in a new market, the company needs to understand:

* What factors influence car prices in the US
* How technical specifications and brand value impact pricing
* How data-driven insights can guide product positioning

This project uses machine learning to answer these questions in a practical and interpretable way.


---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed information on cars sold in the US market, including:

* Engine size, horsepower, and performance metrics
* Car dimensions and weight
* Fuel type and mileage
* Body style and brand
* Market price (target variable)

Each row represents a unique car model with its corresponding attributes.

## Methodology

The project follows an end-to-end machine learning workflow:

1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**

   * Inspected data quality and structure
   * Handled missing values and inconsistencies

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed relationships between features and price
   * Identified correlations and trends
   * Visualized key patterns affecting pricing

3. **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**

   * Encoded categorical variables
   * Scaled numerical features where required

4. **Model Development**

   * Split data into training and testing sets
   * Built regression-based machine learning models
   * Tuned models for better performance

5. **Model Evaluation**

   * Compared predicted vs actual prices
   * Evaluated model accuracy using standard metrics
   * Interpreted feature importance

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Model Comparison (Key Focus)

Two primary models were compared:

* **Linear Regression**

  * Served as a strong baseline model
  * Offered high interpretability and clear feature influence
  * Useful for explaining pricing decisions to business stakeholders

* **Random Forest Regression**

  * Captured non-linear relationships in the data
  * Demonstrated improved predictive performance
  * Highlighted complex feature interactions

This comparison illustrates the practical machine learning trade-off between **interpretability and performance**, ensuring model selection aligns with real-world business needs.


---

## Key Insights

* Engine size, horsepower, and vehicle weight are strong price drivers
* Brand value significantly impacts market pricing
* Fuel efficiency and vehicle size affect pricing differently across segments

These insights can directly support pricing strategy and market entry decisions.

---

## Conclusion

Rather than relying on a single algorithm, this project emphasizes **model comparison** to evaluate both business clarity and predictive capability.

Linear Regression provides transparency and ease of explanation, while Random Forest improves accuracy by capturing complex patterns. Together, they demonstrate a balanced and professional machine learning approach.

This project reflects my ability to:

* Translate business problems into data science solutions
* Apply and compare machine learning models thoughtfully
* Communicate technical results in a business-focused manner

---

## Future Improvements

* Experiment with advanced regression models
* Improve feature selection and tuning
* Deploy the model as a simple web application
