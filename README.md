## 🎯 Problem Statement

A Chinese automobile company is planning to enter the American market. To compete effectively, the company needs to understand:

* What factors influence car prices in the US
* How technical and brand-related features impact pricing
* How data can guide market entry and product positioning

This project answers those questions using machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed information on cars sold in the US market, including:

* Engine size, horsepower, and performance metrics
* Car dimensions and weight
* Fuel type and mileage
* Body style and brand
* Market price (target variable)

Each row represents a unique car model with its corresponding attributes.

## 🧠 Methodology

The project follows an end-to-end machine learning workflow:

1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**

   * Inspected data quality and structure
   * Handled missing values and inconsistencies

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed relationships between features and price
   * Identified correlations and trends
   * Visualized key patterns affecting pricing

3. **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**

   * Encoded categorical variables
   * Scaled numerical features where required

4. **Model Development**

   * Split data into training and testing sets
   * Built regression-based machine learning models
   * Tuned models for better performance

5. **Model Evaluation**

   * Compared predicted vs actual prices
   * Evaluated model accuracy using standard metrics
   * Interpreted feature importance
